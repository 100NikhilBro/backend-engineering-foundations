## Testing and its Types

# Why? 

- dekh bhai testing ka mtlb sirf yeh nhi hai ki - just only checks the code is working right or not 
- basically testing is about that 
    - in future , code does not break
    - new chnages does not break the old features [Regression-Testing]
    - to catch the bugs before reaching to the users 


# Testing?

- It is the process of verifying and validating that a software behave as expected under the d/f conditions 


# Types

- Unit Testing - simple fast and sigle unit like function etc
- Integration Testing - Real Backend Work starts from here 
- E2E Testing - It is Testing for Flow Of User



## AAA Pattern - Test Pattern

- A -> Arrange -> Data Setup
- A -> Act -> Foundation Call
- A -> Assert -> Result Check


# Eg - FoodOrderApplications[Zomato/Swiggy] 

1. Arrange[A] 
   - UserLoggedIn
   - Resaturent Open
   - Check Money in Wallet

2. Act[A]
   - Placing the Order

3. Assert[A]
   - Order Confirmed
   - Money Deducted
   - ETA is shown   




## Mocking 

# Problem
   - Unit Testing mein apne ko DB call krna hai to - Unit Testing Slow ho gyi yaa fail ho gyi
   - The soln of this is Called - Mocking[Fake/Mock] 

# Solution
   - hum mock version bna denge real dependencies ka 
   - Eg -> Fake DB Call , Fake Email Service , Fake Payment Gateway 

# Use of Mocking
   - Always use in Unit Testing
   - As per need use in integration Testing
   - E2E[user-flow] -> try to avoid the Mocking 




## Testing Tools in Nodejs

- Jest -> Unit+Integration Testing
- SuperTest -> API Testing
